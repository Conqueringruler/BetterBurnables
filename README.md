# Better Burnables

One of the things I was really surprised about when I first played BTA was how few burnable items there are, 
especially with some that realistically should be burnable. If there's anything you think I missed, let me know!

## Tons of items now burnable!
As of v. 1.0 the full list is:
- Fallen Leaves
- Cobweb
- Wheat Seeds
- Pumpkin Seeds
